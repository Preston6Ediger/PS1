      <h3>Playstation one</h3>
      <p>The console's origins date back to 1988 where it was originally 
          a joint project between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-ROM 
          for the Super Famicom. Although Nintendo denied the existence
          of the Sony deal as late as March 1991, Sony revealed a Super 
          Famicom with a built-in CD-ROM drive, that incorporated Green Book 
          technology or CD-i, called "Play Station" (also known as SNES-CD) 
          at the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991. However, a day after 
          the announcement at CES, Nintendo announced that it would be breaking 
          its partnership with Sony, opting to go with Philips instead but using 
          the same technology. The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were
          unable to come to an agreement on how revenue would be split between the 
          two companies.[19] The breaking of the partnership infuriated Sony President 
          Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the responsibility of 
          developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo.<p>
